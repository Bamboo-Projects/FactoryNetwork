/**
 * Keys and characters, before Minecraft sees them.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a mixin and not an event.</b> With no screen open,
 * {@code KeyboardHandler.keyPress} handles Escape (the pause menu) and the
 * movement keys ({@code KeyMapping.set}) itself, and only afterwards comes
 * NeoForge's {@code InputEvent.Key} — which cannot be cancelled. An overlay
 * that is meant to get Escape and the arrows while the player keeps moving
 * must sit ahead of that. This is the only place it can.
 *
 * <p>Two injections, one line each, both merely forwarding: the decision is
 * made in {@link Overlays}, where it is testable without a mixin.
